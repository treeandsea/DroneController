= Architecture

This describes the architecture of the project with it's different layers.

== Architecture Type

This will be implemented as layer architecture.
This is useful as we'll have a well defined input and a even more defined output.

== Layers

****
Input Layer::

The input will be different dictionaries which contains observation key value sets from sensors and dictionaries of the target state of the drone.

****

****
Calculation Layer::

This will do the actual calculation to satisfy the requested drone state.
****

****
Output Layer::

This will return a dictionary containing `n` key value pairs of rotor thrusts.
How ever the first RC will aim to control four rotors.
The thrusts are values from 0 to 1. Depending of the type of request it could vary from python dictionary to json object.
This could be useful if this services runs on a different machine than the requester.
